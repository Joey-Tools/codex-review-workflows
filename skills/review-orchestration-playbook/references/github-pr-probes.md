# GitHub PR Probes

Use these recipes when `$review-orchestration-playbook` needs PR metadata, review threads, branch protection, rules, check status, or merge state.

## Prefer Typed `gh`

Start with stable typed `gh` forms:

- `gh pr view --json ...`
- `gh pr view <number> --json number,url,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,mergeStateStatus,mergeable,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`
- `gh pr checks <number>`
- `gh pr status`
- `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/<base>/protection`
- `gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<base>'`

Only write custom `gh api graphql` when typed forms do not expose the field needed for the current decision.

## GraphQL Shape

Keep custom GraphQL queries minimal: request only fields needed for the immediate PR readiness decision.

Do not paste a query containing `$owner`, braces, aliases, multiline selection, or a long field list into an unquoted shell argument such as `-f query=...`.

For complex queries, write a task-scoped `.codex-tmp/.../*.graphql` query file and pass it with `-F` so `gh` reads file contents:

```sh
gh api graphql -F query=@.codex-tmp/.../query.graphql -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F number=<number>
gh api graphql -F query=@.codex-tmp/<task>/query.graphql -F owner=<owner> -F repo=<repo> -F number=<number>
```

Do not use raw-field for a query file; `-f` / `--raw-field` sends the literal `@file.graphql` string.

GraphQL `Field ... doesn't exist on type ...` and `Expected NAME` errors are probe failures. Remove or verify the failing field and retry a smaller query; do not keep expanding the same query.

## REST Paths With Query Strings

When a REST endpoint legitimately contains `?`, quote the whole endpoint so zsh cannot treat it as a glob:

```sh
gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/action.yml?ref=<sha>'
```

Do not use the repository rulesets endpoint with a `ref` query as the branch rules probe. Use `gh api 'repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<base>'` for rules that apply to a branch.

## GitHub Actions Logs

Use `gh pr checks <number>` or typed PR status first to identify the failing run and job. Do not run a chat-visible bare log dump such as `gh run view <run> --job <job> --log` or `gh run view <run> --job <job> --log-failed`.

Save full GitHub Actions logs to a task-scoped file under `.codex-tmp/`, then extract only targeted evidence:

```sh
mkdir -p .codex-tmp/<task>
gh run view <run-id> --repo <owner>/<repo> --job <job-id> --log-failed > .codex-tmp/<task>/<job-id>.failed.log
wc -l -c .codex-tmp/<task>/<job-id>.failed.log
rg -n "FAIL|error:|Exception|XCTAssert|#expect|TEST FAILED" .codex-tmp/<task>/<job-id>.failed.log | sed -n '1,80p'
tail -n 120 .codex-tmp/<task>/<job-id>.failed.log
```

If the targeted extraction is still above roughly 800 lines or 10k original tokens, narrow the pattern or print small line windows around the decisive matches. Do not pipe a large `gh run view --log-failed` stream directly into broad `rg -C` output; saving first lets you count, re-filter, and report only the key lines.
